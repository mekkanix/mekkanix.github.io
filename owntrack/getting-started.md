# Getting Started

The fastest and easiest way to get OwnTrack running is to import it directly in your HTML.  
Add the following lines in the `<head>` section of your file:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ownntrack@1.0.0-beta.1/dist/owntrack.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ownntrack@1.0.0-beta.1/dist/owntrack.min.js"></script>
```

**Important Note**: OwnTrack integrates a built-in system to load external
tracking-related scripts based on the user consent choice. In order to submit
running trackers to the protection guard, you must remove all import
made directly in your HTML.

In order to get OwnTrack control your tracking services, you also need to tell it which services must be submitted to the tracking protection.

```js

```
