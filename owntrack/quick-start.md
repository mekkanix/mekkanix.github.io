# Quick Start

The fastest and easiest way to get OwnTrack running is to import it directly in your HTML.  
Add the following lines in the `<head>` section of your file:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ownntrack@1.0.0-beta.1/dist/owntrack.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ownntrack@1.0.0-beta.1/dist/owntrack.min.js"></script>
```

**Important**: Contrary to instructions given by tracking services providers, you should not add tracking scripts (e.g. `<script>` tags) directly in your code, otherwise they will bypass the protection guard.


```js
// test
```
