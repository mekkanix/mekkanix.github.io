# Quick Start

The fastest and easiest way to get OwnTrack running is to import it directly in your HTML.  
Add the following lines in the `<head>` section of your file:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ownntrack@1.0.0-beta.1/dist/owntrack.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ownntrack@1.0.0-beta.1/dist/owntrack.min.js"></script>
```

**Important**: You **should not** add scripts given by tracking services providers to your code directly, otherwise they will bypass the protection guard. Include them in the OwnTrack coniguration instead (see below).

Provide tracking services details to the configuration object you need to pass to the `OwnTrack` function call:

```js

```
